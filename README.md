Encryption and Decryption applicable to characters, numbers & majority of the special-characters.
    A few special-characters have their limitations which are NOT encryptable here due to 
       end of their list in the embedded character board in computers' memory on a 
        certain special-character. As this program involved adding and subtracting
          the given Text to make the individual alphabets ahead or behind from 
           their actual value, hence those last special-characters on the 
            list do not have any charcters ahead of them which thus give
             an unidentified character as an encrypted message which is
              practically impossible to decrypt as it doesn't actually
               exist.
